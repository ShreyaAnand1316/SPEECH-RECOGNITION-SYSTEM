OVERVIEW :

Project Overview :
This project demonstrates a Simple LED Control System using an Arduino Uno. It enables users to control the state of two LEDs using two push buttons: one for turning both LEDs ON and the other for turning them OFF. The system also incorporates software debouncing to ensure reliable button state detection. This project is ideal for learning the basics of digital input/output and implementing state-based control using microcontrollers.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED :

1)Microcontroller: Arduino Uno.

2)Push Buttons: 2 (for ON and OFF commands).

3)LEDs: 2 (for visual feedback).

4)Resistors:
-330 Ω (2, for limiting current to LEDs).
-10 kΩ (2, for pull-down configuration of push buttons).

5)Breadboard: For easy circuit assembly.

6)Connecting Wires: For connections between components.

7)Power Source: USB cable or external 5V power supply.


USES AND APPLICATIONS :

1)LED Control:
Learn to control LEDs using push buttons and Arduino.
Use this as a building block for more complex control systems.
User Input Systems:

2)Replace LEDs with other devices (e.g., relays or motors) to create control systems for appliances or gadgets.
Educational Purposes:

3)Ideal for beginners to understand button interfacing, digital outputs, and software debouncing techniques.
Basic Automation:

4)Implement in simple home automation systems for manual control of devices.
Prototyping:

5)Use this project as the base for developing more advanced input-output control systems.
